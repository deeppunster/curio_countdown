countdown-04.py - next edition of countdown program.

This example of using curio comes from the curio tutorial.  Please see the
README.md file for how to access it.

Explanation from tutorial:

However, itâ€™s not necessary to [cancel the task] in the monitor. Change the
parent task to include a timeout and a cancellation request like this:

Notes:
    (start the monitor with:

        python3 -m curio.monitor

        commands:
            ps          list tasks
            where <n>   get stack trace for a task
            cancel <n>  cancel a task

    This edition no longer hangs.
