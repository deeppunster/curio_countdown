# curio_countdown - Curio (async/await) tutorial

This is the curio tutorial with some additions using the **aside** command to
allow multiple cores to be used.

**step-by-step directory**

This directory contains a separate script for each step in the tutorial.

**Source**

The tutorial is located at
https://curio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html.  However, apparently one
must first go to https://curio.readthedocs.io and click on "Curio - A Tutorial
Introduction" to get there.

**Requirements**

In addition to the requirements that will be loaded with the requirements.txt
file, one must also base this on modern Python (3.6) or later.
